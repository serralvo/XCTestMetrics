## Features
- [x] 🕵️‍♂️ Help to identify flaky tests.
- [x] 📊 Give the big picture of project tests, number of failures, when it happened, percentage of flakiness.
- [x] ⚡️ Easy and fast setup.

## Requirements
- Xcode 11 

## Installation
Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

## Usage
The usage of XCTestMetrics is based on two steps: the first one is register each build result, the second one is display all results using a report.

### First Step:
- Run project tests.
- Get the path of your project inside `DerivedData` folder. 
  - Will be something like this: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/YourProject-gybqxixuerfernzjaklbxkwwstqj`
- Finally, call `log` command using derived data path:

```
$ xc-test-metrics log path-to-derived-data
```
- That's it! A `xctestmetrics-output` folder will be created to store all logs.

⚠️ Important, do it for every build of your project, use this tool on your continuous integration system.

### Second Step:
First question, which report you want: Slack or HTML?

#### Slack
- You will need to input a webhook URL:
  - Will be somethink like this: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
  - [Check here how to create a webhook.](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
- Run: 
```
$ xc-test-metrics report slack your-web-hook-url
```
- That's it! The message with metrics will be send to Slack.

#### HTML
- Run:
```
$ xc-test-metrics report html
```
- That's it! The report file (index.html) will be stored into `xctestmetrics-report` folder.

## Motivation
The first thing to do when your codebase has flaky tests is **get metrics about it**. With data you can pick the test that failed more times for example, to fix, re-write or even delete.
